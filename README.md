### Overview
- Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc. This is useful as it can be used on microcontrollers such as Raspberri Pis with the help of an external microphone.
Speech recognition technologies such as Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant and Siri are changing the way people interact with their devices, homes, cars, and jobs. The technology allows us to talk to a computer or device that interprets what weâ€™re saying in order to respond to our question or command.
